# dsa-coursera

This is a repository for myself to learn about the Data Structures and Algorithms from the following course:
https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms

This repository serves as a place where I can write my notes and reflections upon what I study. 
It also serves as an archive for which I can come back to when I want to refresh my skills.
