# dsa-coursera

This is a repository for myself to learn about the Data Structures and Algorithms from the following course:
https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms

This repository serves as a place where I can write my notes and reflections upon what I study.
It also serves as an archive for which I can come back to when I want to refresh my skills.

I use C++ for solving the problems. The compiler options as instructed by the course:

```bash
g++ -pipe -O2 -std=C++11
```

# Problems
